            <h3>Productionâ€‘grade Quantum ML</h3>
            <p>
              We combine classical feature engineering with a Variational Quantum Classifier to
              capture nonâ€‘linear structure in FTSE 100 dynamics. The system trains on a sliding
              3â€‘year window ending yesterday and makes intraday calls at five time points.
            </p>

            <h3>Transparent, reproducible signals</h3>
            <p>
              Signals are derived from 8 interpretable inputs like RSI, MACD, moving averages,
              volatility and volume regimes. All steps are logged and cached for fast reloads.
            </p>

            <h3>Fast path to insights</h3>
            <p>
              The app caches trained results per date and reuses the latest model to deliver
              answers instantly, even after restarts.
